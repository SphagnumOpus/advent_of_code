# advent_of_code

For 2023 I'm honing my C# coding.

For 2022 I'm still simply using python and getting used to Visual Studio Code Usage

For 2021 I'm using Python

For 2020 I'm trying to learn the rust programming language as I go through the advent of code problems...
   (Hopefully the quality of the rust code improves over the days.)
   
I've also checked in my 2019 code, written in the C programming language, done in 2019 while the puzzles were being posted.
I didn't get all the way through the month.

I don't guarantee that a particular day will be elegant or free from debug statements!
